# Unified CCX CTI Protocol Sample Code
This project contains sample code to be used with the [Unified CCX CTI Protocol](https://developer.cisco.com/site/contact-center-express/docs/#cti-protocol-overview), a set of rules and message definitions for enabling a client to receive telephony information and control telephony functions through Unified CCX such as making and receiving voice calls and caller identification.

Documentation for the CCX CTI Protocol can be found in the [CTI Protocol Developer Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/site/contact-center-express/docs/#cti-protocol-dev-guide).

## Disclaimer
These sample codes are only a sample and are **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample codes are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the SDK/APIs
- Start as a base for developers to build upon

## Support Notice
Support for the APIs and SDKs are provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the SDKs/APIs is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

For any issues you encounter, please post your question to the [CTI Protocol Forum](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/express-cti).
