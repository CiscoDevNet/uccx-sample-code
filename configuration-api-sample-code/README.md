# Unified CCX Configuration API Sample Code
This project contains sample code to be used with the [Unified CCX Configuration API](), which are REST APIs for the configuration of inbound and outbound applications on UCCX.

Documentation for the CCX Configuration APIs can be found in the [Configuration API Developer Guide]().

## Disclaimer
These sample codes are only a sample and are **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample codes are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the SDK/APIs
- Start as a base for developers to build upon

## Support Notice
Support for the APIs and SDKs are provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the SDKs/APIs is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.

For any issues you encounter, please post your question to the [Configuration API Forum](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/express-configuration-api).
