## Disclaimer
The code in this repo is sample code only. It is **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample code is meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the SDK/APIs

## Support Notice
Support for the APIs and SDKs are provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the SDKs/APIs are properly integrated into 3rd party applications.
