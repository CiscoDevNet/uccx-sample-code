# Cisco Identity Service SDK Sample Code
This project contains sample code to be used with the [Cisco Identity Service Client SDK](https://developer.cisco.com/site/contact-center-express/docs/#cisco-identity-service-client-sdk-overview), Java APIs that allows end users to seemlessly use various web applications and applications built with the REST APIs within the Cisco Contact Center solution after a single login.

Documentation for the Cisco Identity Service SDK can be found in the [Cisco Identity Service Client SDK Guide](https://developer.cisco.com/site/contact-center-express/docs/#cisco-identity-service-client-sdk-guide).

## Disclaimer
These sample codes are only a sample and are **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample codes are meant to:

- Illustrate how to use the SDK/APIs
- Start as a base for developers to build upon

## Support Notice
Support for the APIs and SDKs are provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the SDKs/APIs is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.
