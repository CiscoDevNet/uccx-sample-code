# Unified CCX Scripting Sample Code
This project contains sample code to be used with [Unified CCX Scripting](), the ability for developers to program the business logic of how to handle a Voice Call or an Http Contact.

Documentation for the CCX Scripting can be found in the [Scripting and Development Series Guide]().

## Disclaimer
These sample codes are only a sample and are **NOT guaranteed to be bug free and production quality**.

The sample codes are meant to:
- Illustrate how to use the SDK/APIs
- Start as a base for developers to build upon

## Support Notice
Support for the APIs and SDKs are provided on a "best effort" basis via DevNet. Like any custom deployment, it is the responsibility of the partner and/or customer to ensure that the customization works correctly and this includes ensuring that the SDKs/APIs is properly integrated into 3rd party applications.
